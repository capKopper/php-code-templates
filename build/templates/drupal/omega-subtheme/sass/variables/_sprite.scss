/**
 * This contains only the definitions of the sprites. Further processing is made
 * in the abstractions/sprite @mixin.
 *
 * Each definition is related to a specific folder that contains the related
 * images. Such folder is, for example:
 *   [base-path-to-the-compass-images-folder]/sprites/[sprite-name]
 *
 * The sprite definition contains the basic settings, as well as some more
 * advanced configuration for each existing image (spacing, position etc.).
 * For example, if we have an image wich name is "arrow-right", we could
 * override some defaut settings like this:
 * @code
 *   icon-arrow-right-spacing: 40px,
 *   icon-arrow-right-position: 100%,
 * @endcode
 *
 * The sprite @mixin may be used like this:
 * @code
 *   // Add the "arrow-right" background (image, position, repeat) and specify
 *   // the element width and height.
 *   @include sprite-icon(arrow-right, true);
 *
 *   // Move the image position vertically, 2 pixels higher than expected.
 *   @include sprite-icon(arrow-right, false, 0, +2px);
 * @endcode
